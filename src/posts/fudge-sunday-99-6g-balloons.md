Yes. 6G! Here we were just waiting for 5G.

So, how long until we see a consumer accessible democratized access to the technology?

Let‚Äôs take a look back then look ahead.

 **1989 = Marketing...**

Setting aside the AT&T ‚Äúyou will‚Äù meme‚Ä¶ the only thing holding back telecom in the 1990s was‚Ä¶ telecom itself.

 **1993 = (soon to be) Memes...**

The AT&T [‚Äúyou will‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&v=iJK792H3eBU) meme will reach a 30th anniversary soon.

 **2010 = Progress...**

Fast forward 11 years‚Ä¶

 **2021 = More progress...**

Skype and Zoom might have been first for cross mobile /desktop / device video conferencing but Apple eventually caught up late last year.

**[Finally...](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212619?utm_campaign=Start%20the%20week%20more%20informed&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)**

As of late 2021, you can now join a FaceTime call from an Android or Windows device. FaceTime links arrived in¬†iOS 15 and macOS Monterey meaning (almost) anyone can join a FaceTime call from a web browser.
